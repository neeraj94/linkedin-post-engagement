Plugin: Defect Report & Required Enhancements
A. Observed Issues

Premature halt without feedback

Execution stops after processing a few URLs and does not continue.

No alert, toast, or log entry explains the halt.

Duplicate commenting by the same logged-in user

The plugin posts a new comment even when the same logged-in account has already commented on the post.

This violates the intended strict skip rule.

Insufficient execution visibility

UI only shows counts (e.g., “URLs found”, “logged-in URLs found”).

There is no per-URL, per-action trace (opened/liked/commented/skipped) visible to the user.

Errors not surfaced

Authentication or runtime errors (e.g., session expiry, rate limits, DOM changes) are not clearly logged or shown in the UI.

B. Required Fixes & Enhancements
1) Reliability & Progression

Implement a watchdog/timeout per URL (configurable, e.g., 15–60s). If no action completes within the timeout:

Log a WARN/ERROR with the URL and the last known step.

Skip to the next URL after a bounded retry (e.g., up to 2 retries with exponential backoff).

Ensure the run continues through all URLs regardless of individual failures.

2) Strict Idempotency (Skip Rules)

Before attempting any action on a post:

Like check: If already liked by the logged-in account → skip like.

Comment check: If the logged-in account has any existing comment on the post → skip comment.

Apply the following matrix:

Neither liked nor commented → Like + Comment.

Liked only → Comment only.

Commented only → Like only.

Both present → Skip entirely.

Add defensive double-checks (e.g., confirm state after action; if action didn’t “stick”, retry once, then log and continue).

3) Per-URL Execution Trace (UI & Logs)

For each URL, output a structured, real-time trace in the UI:

Opened: <URL>

Skipped Like: already liked

Skipped Comment: already commented by <account>

Liked: <URL>

Commented: <URL>

Error: <URL> | <error_code> | <message> (attempt X/Y)

On completion: Done: <URL>

Also provide a run summary at the end:

Total URLs, Processed, Liked, Commented, Skipped (with reasons), Failed.

4) Error Handling & Diagnostics

Standardize error codes (examples):
AUTH_401, AUTH_EXPIRED, RATE_LIMIT, NETWORK_TIMEOUT, DOM_NOT_FOUND, ACTION_VERIFICATION_FAILED.

Show a concise UI alert/toast for critical failures (e.g., not logged in), and keep full details in the log panel.

Include timestamps, attempt counters, and URL context in every log line.

Provide an option to export logs (CSV/JSON) from the UI.

C. UI/UX Enhancements (Visibility & Control)

Interactive status panel with live streaming logs; filters (All/Success/Skipped/Errors).

Progress bar + counters: processed / total, successes, skips, errors.

Current URL indicator (clickable to open in a new tab).

Controls: Pause/Resume, Stop, “Dry-Run” (detect only, no actions).

Inputs (clearly labeled with tooltips):

Comment text (single source of truth).

Random delay Min–Max (seconds).

Per-URL timeout.

Retry limit and backoff strategy.

Display the logged-in LinkedIn account name/avatar to avoid confusion.

Provide success/failure toasts for run start/finish, with a link to the summary.

D. Acceptance Criteria (Testable)

Continuity: Given 50 valid LinkedIn post URLs with mixed states, the run finishes without halting, producing a per-URL trace and final summary.

Idempotency: The plugin never posts a new comment when the same logged-in user has an existing comment on that post; it never re-likes an already liked post.

Matrix behavior:

Unliked & uncommented → both actions performed exactly once.

Liked only → only comment is added.

Commented only → only like is added.

Both present → skipped with reason displayed.

Visibility: For every URL, the UI shows Opened / Liked / Commented / Skipped / Error messages with timestamps.

Error surfacing: Authentication expiry triggers a visible alert and a logged AUTH_EXPIRED error; the run either pauses with a prompt or aborts gracefully with a summary.

Logging: Logs are exportable and include URL, action, status, code, message, timestamp, and attempt count.

Delays: Actions respect the configured random delay window.

E. Non-Functional Requirements

Resilience: DOM variation tolerant; bounded retries with backoff.

Performance: Sequential processing with delay; UI remains responsive.

Compliance: Honor skip rules and user controls; avoid excessive requests that could trigger platform throttling.
