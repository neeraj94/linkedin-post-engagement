Plugin Review Request

I would like you to review this plugin to ensure it works as intended. The functionality and requirements should be as follows:

1. Input Handling

The plugin should allow me to paste raw data into a text box.

From this data, it must automatically extract all LinkedIn post URLs.

2. URL Processing

The plugin should open each extracted URL sequentially, one by one.

For each post, it must verify whether the logged-in account has already liked or commented on the post.

3. Interaction Logic

If the post is neither liked nor commented, the plugin should perform both actions: like the post and submit a predefined comment.

If the post is already liked but not commented, the plugin should skip the like and only add the comment.

If the post is already commented but not liked, the plugin should skip the comment and only like the post.

If the post is already both liked and commented, the plugin should skip that post entirely.

4. Comment Content

The comment text should come from a single input field within the plugin.

The same content will be reused for commenting across all posts.

5. Execution Control

The plugin should apply a random delay (in seconds) while opening URLs and performing actions.

This delay should be configurable through input fields in the plugin settings.

6. User Interface (UI) Expectations

The plugin UI should be very interactive, modern, and visually appealing.

The design should be clean and intuitive, ensuring that even non-technical users can easily:

Paste their data into the text box.

Provide the comment text.

Configure the delay settings.

Use clear labels, tooltips, and confirmation messages to guide the user.

Include a progress indicator (e.g., a counter showing how many URLs have been processed).

Provide status feedback (e.g., “Liked and Commented”, “Skipped – Already Liked”, etc.) for transparency.

7. Current Issue to Verify

At present, the plugin does not appear to be commenting (or it is unclear whether it is doing so correctly). Please verify:

That the plugin successfully opens each extracted URL one by one.

That the like and comment logic follows the rules described above.

That the random configurable delay between actions is working.

That the UI is interactive and user-friendly, with proper feedback and progress tracking.
